# üñ•Ô∏è Smart contracts

All Eyeseek codebase is open-source includung Solidity smart contracts and frontend code. You can find all the code on our [Github](https://github.com/Eyeseek-org)

## üìú Contract deployment
[Smart contract architecture](https://github.com/Eyeseek-org/diamond) follows the [Diamond Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) and is deployed on the following blockchains:


|Type|Polygon|BNB Chain|Optimism|Fantom|
|--------|---------|--------|---------|---------|
|**Network**|x|x|xx|xx|

*Each diamond consists of 8 smart contracts, wrapped in a single proxy represented in the table.*

TBD

Disclaimer: 
- There is no best-practices pattern in the market doing the same functionality as we do, use the app at your own risk.
- Smart contracts are upgradeable and not audited because of the cost, though the code will be always transparent and our team ready to explain any part of the code
