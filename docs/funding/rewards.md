# Rewards
As a project owner or fan of created project, you have multiple ways how to incentivize backers to donate to your project via Rewards.

## 1. Classic rewards
Traditional crowdfunding rewards are based on trust between the project owner and backers. 
Project owner promises to deliver a reward to backers if the goal is reached. This is the most common way how to incentivize backers to donate to your project.

- Owner can create any amount of rewards, **obligated to provide enough information** for backers to understand what they will receive.
- **Eyeseek does not store backers information like email or physical address.**. Only way for owners how to retrieve it, is to create their own form and ask backers to fill it out.
- We provide Notification tooling to notify backers about the project progress and when the project is finished. 

TBD notification 

**Eyeseek will not guaranteed classic reward settlement** between the owner and backers, donate on your own risk.
Most we can do is contact the owner on backers behalf and try to get official statement.


## 2. ERC20 token rewards
Project owner of fans can offer ERC20 fungible tokens to lock into the application as a reward. 
It could be for example:
- Utility token
- Loyalty tokenized point
- In-game currency
- DAO governance token

Creator can define how much tokens will be locked for each reward. It is responsibility of the backer to evaluate whether this type of reward is worth the backing.

- **Token has to follow standard ERC20 interface.**
- Smart contract guarantees that tokens are locked and **cannot be manipulated**.
- If the project is successful, tokens are unlocked and sent to backers. Unclaimed rewards are returned to the creator
- If the project fails, all rewards are returned to the creator.

## 3. ERC1155 NFT rewards
Project owner of fans can offer ERC1155 semi-fungible tokens to lock into the application as a reward. 
It could be for example:
- Gaming assets (swords, skins)
- Card collection (trading cards)
- Art collection (digital paintings created in batches)
- Tickets (concert, event, etc.)

Creator can define how much items could be claimed for each reward.
- **Token has to follow standard ERC1155 interface.** ERC721 will not be supported, as they represent unique digital units. *ERC721 NFTs could be offered as part of Classic rewards*.
- Smart contract guarantees that tokens are locked and **cannot be manipulated**.
- If the project is successful, tokens are unlocked and sent to backers. Unclaimed rewards are returned to the creator
- If the project fails, all rewards are returned to the creator.
