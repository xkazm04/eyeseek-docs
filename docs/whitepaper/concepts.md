# 1. Key concepts

**Eyeseek**'s philosophy is composed of 4 principles that are easy to define but complex to follow in every application aspect in order to grow.

#### Gamification

No matter which content is offered to the user, the journey's feeling must always be playful, fun and satisfying. Using the **mobile app must be always more entertaining than doing nothing** or browsing socials like Facebook or Twitter to reach the level of probability that users will engage in spare time. Application variant in mobile form is necessary to support user engagement thanks to its simple user interface, 24/7 accessibility, and push notifications keeping users in touch.

The target is to replicate or **get inspired by** successfully implemented **gamification concepts** in daily routines as [Runtastic](https://www.runtastic.com/) achieved in a healthy lifestyle (10m+ downloads in Google Store) or [Duolingo](https://en.duolingo.com/) in language education (100m + downloads in Google Store).

The primary **motivation of use** by design **must have a form of enjoyment** rather than the expectation of wealthy income, which current [_play-to-earn_](https://www.billelafros.com/problems-with-nft-games-play-to-earn)[games suffer](https://www.billelafros.com/problems-with-nft-games-play-to-earn). Helping people has to be similarly fulfilling, like doing quests in World of Warcraft, evaluating products and services have to bring similar enjoyment like swapping girls and boys on Tinder, and donations to charity projects have to be similarly engaging, like betting on Pittsburgh Penguins hockey games.

#### Reputation system

All wallet actions will create a picture of the personality behind without any knowledge of his identity, as Eyeseek will not require email or identity pairing with a wallet address. Address reputation profile will consist of dozens of partial profiles developed by activities done in each application module.

**Any other user would be able to see whether a specific address behaves fairly** in general, and which specific skill he handles best. For example, users often contributing to software development issues in React will have a publicly known level of React mastery (_let's call it Proof of Skill_). Based on that, other users could rely on this person and ask for help.

Designing a fair reputation system is the fundamental pillar to

1. Achieving **autonomous content regulation** , keeping long-term valid content and natural anti-spam protection without the need for the development team's or DAO's intervention in later stages.
2. Create a **network of specialists** based on proven effort in a given industry in hobby time, as an alternative or complement to talking shit on Linked just to build a likable personal brand.

The main **challenges** to face would be to detect and eliminate [spam bots](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/telegram-spam) or **organized fraud** aiming to take advantage of the reward system or reputation benefits. Detection algorithms will evaluate behavior in each application's functional modules, add time dimension and combine the effort of the community and team in the early stages to put together a reliable environment.

Total reputation score could be, in theory, supplemented by [3rd party services](https://www.orangeprotocol.io/). This would help mainly in the initial phases (together with data from beta access) to determine some of the reliable actors the application could trust.

#### Community-driven content

Eyeseek's modules **design must become use case agnostic** to gain longevity and shape the product image users care about rather than the development team. We aim to deliver a framework - ways to show how the application could be used and open doors to adopt new industrial use cases without the need for complex implementation.

This fundamental concept is retaken from the gaming space, where top sold games in history are those providing modding tools and freedom to build new content ([#1 Minecraft, #2 GTA V](https://gamertweak.com/most-played-popular-games)) on top of the engaging core. Of course, Eyeseek cannot be compared to top titles in the gaming industry, but there is a certain lesson to let the community participate in building additional product blocks.

Despite the probability that first use cases will relate to software development and online services, blindness caused by Eyseek's team's geopolitical position must not limit the product's direction. Power will be given to the community by providing a possibility to express feedback and tooling to design own use cases inside the app without technical knowledge.

Technically this will be achieved by using NoSQL database with application categories and different skills, which could be extended by users from the application interface without knowledge of any code. To prevent spam we either allow this feature accessible only to users with trusted reputation or implement a verification process and involve the product team or DAO.

#### Reward system

Design of the reward system and token supply is another key role to take in mind. Token value has to be high and stable enough to let users feel like putting skin in the game, as an advantage over regular web apps, although **Eyeseek's reward economy is not designed for users to replace daily job**.

The **target** of the reward system is mainly to **incentivize personal challenge** s by solving quests generated by other users, and spending rewarded pennies on charity, self-promotion or doing fun challenges in-app.
