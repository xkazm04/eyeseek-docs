# 3. Shark Tank

One of the more challenging parts is to keep Eyseek's token utility alive in a way that will still follow key project concepts and fuel other modules together with user engagement. The long-term devaluating token could cause losing engagement due to the usage of token as a rewarding mechanism, the target is to avoid the scenario [Stepn experienced after few months of launch](https://nftnewstoday.com/2022/06/08/stepn-crashes-to-insane-levels-top-web3-project-dead), when their token rapidly devaluated.

To balance stable token supply and add reason to use the app, Eyeseek comes with a concept of **useful ads and promotions**. The challenge here is **to transfer a traditionally annoying experience into something fun** and valuable for users and advertisers and make promotion likable and demanded.

Based on the [survey results](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/74-of-people-are-tired-of-social-media-ads-but-theyre-effective), the **problem of most ads** is that they are **not aligned** with the target's interest, penetrate space where **not required** , and often services or products are **not trustworthy**. To solve all three issues, we'll use Tinder-like mechanisms to achieve only related ads that will be shown to users.

In a similar manner Tinder users can parametrize preferred age of opposites, or their interests and location range. Eyeseek users can parametrize which industry and subcategories they are interested in to display only related ads and promotions. All ads and promotion will be shown only in a specific part of the application accessible by free will, motivated by reputation points.

We'll take Tinder's game to the next level and allow to compare "liked" products by a user between each other and provide valuable feedback thanks to the comparison and possibly integrate with portals like [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/software/product). It's like Tinder would create _Miss contest_ from a set of girls/boys you previously appreciated, but with the difference, this could help industries improve.

**Challenges**

Similar to bounties, promoters, users or the development team would be able to incentivize feedback given by users, this time by creating community challenges.

The promotion module will use **smart contracts to gamify advertisement** in two ways

1. **Location (geo) based challenges**

A **promoter can target multiple tags in the application map for a time-limited period** to visit, in return for discounted service/product or custom entitlement given by the event's creator. Geo-challenges will cost no fee but require a certain stage of the adopted network to be attractive for the creators.

_Example: Tour de beer_

_Promoter can tag 10 pubs on a city map with a limited time of one month to visit and taste a local specialty. Pubs will have to confirm users' attendance. If all tags are collected, the user is rewarded by increased behavioral reputation, possible reward created by promoter or custom entitlement like "Prague Beermaster" which won't affect any of application's features._

1. **General challenges**

**Promoter can use a network of industry specialists** and public stats to **request** their **feedback** for the existing product or service, backed by the amount of tokens to give away if the challenge is fulfilled.

_Example: Best web3 data provider voting_

_Promoter can raise an incentivization with ruled set by a smart contract: "I'll let burn 10 000 tokens if products in category [Software development] - [Web3] - [Data provider] will get 1000 votes and 500 comparison decisions from userbase, with condition voting is allowed only to users with Solidity skill reputation over 20._

#### Advertisement fees

Advertisement fees will start on **10 Eyeseek tokens per day,** which should be a matter of pennies, easily achievable by collecting rewards in the Quests module. Gas costs could be avoided by directly paying for uncollected rewards by the wallet.

**Challenges** could be generated **for free** as a motivation to do creative in-app content, also no fee would be taken for burnt bounties.

Both promotions and challenges could be reported by users, and in case of abusive or non-related content to the assigned category canceled without refund.

#### Use-case agnostic framework

This module could serve as **promotion** of ideas and business **across any industry** both on a global level or in given local markets using an application map:

- Product promotion
- Service promotion
- Job market using skill reputation from Quests
- Event promotion

Map and **geo-based features won't be implemented in the early Eyeseek stages** as they are attractive to work with only if the number of users and community reaches certain boundaries when the app spreads worldwide or achieve concentrated communities in specific cities.

The industry-agnostic approach of the architecture and user interface would allow Eyeseek to establish contact with anyone. The logical strategy is to cooperate initially with teams sharing similar backgrounds - web3 startups pushing their first real ideas forward. Thousands of small teams and dreamers across 50+ blockchains are trying to succeed in web3, young groups open for mutual aid.

The next step after reaching credibility and community size would be to penetrate in traditional space based on our community decomposition = if the community consists of 90% devs, we will spend more effort bringing in traditional IT services and less effort on building a business around gastronomy for example.

#### Accessibility

A benefit of making a social app concept is its target audience, where everyone is a potential user. Although the primary focus starts from the web3 community because of their engagement in the space, the app has to be designed to be attractive also for blockchain outsiders, regular folks and businesses.

To achieve that, integrations must happen with current web services and companies behind them. Eyeseek will offer **scripts to connect with Shark tank** module easily. From a user perspective **one-click solution to share an idea** or campaign is similar to sharing on Twitter or Facebook. The script will include wallet authentication and a predefined template for promotion.

The **onboarding process** has to be simple to avoid repetitive technical obstacles and **documented for developers, business owners and users**. Documentation is often underestimated tool for ideas clarification to 3rd parties. We'll mix strategies to distribute essential information across the Eyeseek website, mobile app, and documentation portal with smart search, easy to maintain (tools like Gitbook or Docusaurus).

The success of Eyeseek will depend on the ability to be integrated by partnered projects. Rather than directly compete with other businesses, we will provide a layer from which everyone could benefit and use it as an additional engagement tool in business strategy.
